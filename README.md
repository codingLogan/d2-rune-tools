# diablo-2-runewords

## Features

This site provides a simple way for you to find what runewords are available to you, and what items you currently have.

Example, if you're playing and loot a 3 Socket Crystal Sword, it would be nice to know what runewords could be used in it quickly and easily.
1. Sort by character level.
1. Filter by 3 sockets.
1. Filter by "Swords", "Melee Weapons", or "Weapons".
1. Read through the options you have for your character level.

By using the filters you'll quickly know
* If you can create something great right now.
* If you need to keep looting for a while.
* It will also let you know if it's worth keeping your socketed item in your stash. If no runewords match up, maybe sell it instead.

Other features
- Sort by name, or required character level
- Filter by number of sockets and item type
- View rune crafting requirements for levelling up your runes

## Forewarning

### Ladder Runewords
Some runewords are Ladder Only, but the site does not yet report which ones.
For now, before using a runeword **do a quick search for it if you are NOT playing a Ladder Character**.

### Diablo 2 Resurrected Only
There are a few runewords specifically introduced for Diablo 2 Resurrected.  These are NOT available in Classic Diablo 2.
* Plague
* Pattern
* Unbending Will
* Wisdom
* Obsession
* Flickering Flame
* Mist

## Data Cleansing

Arreat Summit is a great resource for Classic Diablo 2 information,
but there are some inconsistencies that are cleansed by this site's filters.

A particular point of cleansing is the item types for runewords.
For example, there are many ways the text describes Staves,
and each of these are condensed into one filter of "Staves (Not Orbs)"
* Staves
* Staves (Not Orbs)
* Staves* (Not Orbs)
